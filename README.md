# Escape!

My first game ever. Made for the [DIY Gamer Kit](http://www.techwillsaveus.com/shop/diy-kits/diy-gamer-kit-with-arduino-pre-built/).

The runner has to stay alive by jumping obstacles as they appear.

## Instructions

Press UP to jump.

Press START to pause the game.

Turn sound on/off by pausing the game (START), then LEFT.

### To Do

 - Different shaped obstacles, and higher
 - Gaps in floor that have to be cleared
 - Walls you can cross by ducking under them
 - Different level floors
 - Winning! Being rewarded for finishing the game
   - It having an ending and leaving you wanting more
   - More can be: more games or making changes to the game yourself
